A handful of blue dogs did and that‚Äôs how they negotiated the Carper Ammendment. The tax break was good sweetener to keep progs on board. Manchin temper tantrum reduced Carper by 3 weeks.

Anyone with a functioning brain knows that they will do whatever Biden tells them to do. If Biden actually was working to get the American people something closer to a living wage, they would have voted for it."
